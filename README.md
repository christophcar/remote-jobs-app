I build this portal for remote jobs as **final project at the neuefische developer bootcamp**.

Feel free to scroll around and find a daily curated selection of up-to-date remote jobs in Germany.

The following tech stack was used to build this app: 

**React.js, React-Router, Cypress, Redux, Jest, Styled-Components, TDD, Storybook, Puppeteer, Moments.js.**
